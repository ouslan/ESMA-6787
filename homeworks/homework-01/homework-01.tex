\section*{Problem 1: Syllabus Acknowledgment}
I have read the syllabus, understand its contents,and have no questions.

\section*{Problem 2: Definitions in Your Own Words}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Experiment:} Method to answer a research question, where the researcher controles an 
    environment and only changes one or many treatment holding all other things constant
	\item \textbf{Experimental unit:} unit that will receive the treatment
	\item \textbf{Observational unit:}  it is the person, thing or event where are studying. 
	\item \textbf{Background variable:} Are all the factor that can affect the study but are not controlled for 
	\item \textbf{Independent (predictor) variable:} It is what is applied as treatment
	\item \textbf{Dependent (response) variable:} It is the outcome or what we observe after we apply the treatment
	\item \textbf{Confounded factors:} Are un observe factors that affect both the treatment and the observed factor
	\item \textbf{Experimental error:} It is how far our experiment is from the reality.
	\item \textbf{Randomization:} Treatments are applied randomly
	\item \textbf{Replicate:} recreation of the experiments with the same settings and specification but with different data 
\end{itemize}

\section*{Problem 3: Lady Tasting Tea}
\begin{itemize}
	\item[(a)] Units in this experiment: The tea cups
	\item[(b)] Treatments in this experiment: The order of what was added first to the tea
	\item[(c)] Randomization method using physical devices: order cups from 1-8 then randomize the order with a program
	\item[(d)] Adjustments if cups differ in material (porcelain vs china): Assigned cups type randomly to each group
\end{itemize}

\section*{Problem 4: Paper Airplane Experiment}
\begin{itemize}
	\item[(a)] Experimental treatments: The experiments would be each of the 3 recipe, with the simple classic airplane as the controle group
	\item[(b)] Experimental units and homogeneity: to ensure homogeneity we would use the same type paper, thrown from the same location.
	\item[(c)] Randomization process: when we get the 20 papers we assign the folding recepte randomly to them
	\item[(d)] Procedure for applying treatment to unit: when the recepte is chacen use the as much possible machines or tools ensure cons
	\item[(e)] Measurement process: Mesure the distance the plane flew 
\end{itemize}

\section*{Problem 5: Gasoline Mileage Study}
\begin{itemize}
	\item[(a)] Comparison of strengths and weaknesses:
    Design experiment A is convenient but their are many variables that are not controlled like the 
    brand of car, driving habits, etc. Design B has more strengths given that we use the same care for the same amount of time but a problem that could 
    have the experiment is segregation of the vie vale over time. Design C addresses the concerns of the previouse experiemnt.
	\item[(b)] Identification of true experiment(s) and justification:
    Experiment C would say it is the best experiment given that it controles for the most amount of factors buy using the same vehicle.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Problem 6: Baseball League as Experiment}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Treatments and units: The teams and the unites are the games
	\item Application of treatment to unit: The application of the treatment would be to 
    that a particular team is playing at its expectations of victory is the outcome
	\item Randomization and replication: Randomizing the matching of the team and ensuring that each team plays each other for the replications
	\item Possibility and use of blocking: Could be used if there are confounding factors like home-field advantage or team skill differences, but it might not be necessary if teams are assumed to be comparable.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Problem 7: Tomato Fertilizer and Variety}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Experimental setup: We would devide the plot of land into quadrents and each will have a groups with all combinations of Fertilizer and seed type.
    In addition it will consist of a control group with no Fertilizer and a comon tomato seed.
	\item Use of replication and randomization: The randomization is applied to which section of the plot of land receives the combination of Fertilizer and seed
	\item Additional design principles in second season: rotate the treatments, long-term replication, seasonal variation consideration, increased precision in measurement and control of weather variability.  
\end{itemize}

\section*{Problem 8: Hand Washing Experiment}
\begin{itemize}
	\item[(a)] Experimental unit: The experimental unit is the individual subject (person) participating in the hand washing experiment
	\item[(b)] Factors: Wash water temperature, detergent concentration
	\item[(c)] Response:The response is the bacterial count on the palms of the subjects.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Problem 9: Real-life Application}
I would say most economic problem would benefit form experiments designs given that it changes the results from corrolation to causality.

\section*{Problem 10: Variance as Quadratic Form}
Suppose $y_1,\ldots,y_n \sim N(\mu,\sigma^2)$. Let $y = (y_1,\ldots,y_n)'$ and let $\bar{y} = \frac{1}{n}\sum^n_{i=1}y_i$. Show that 
$\frac{1}{n-1}\sum^n_{i=1}(y_i - \bar{y})^2$ can be written as $y'Ay$ for sum matrix $A$. Identify the A matrix.
\[
\frac{1}{n-1}(y - \bar{y}\mathbf{1})'(y - \bar{y}\mathbf{1})
\]

\[
y - \bar{y}\mathbf{1} = y - \left( \frac{1}{n} \mathbf{1}'y \right)\mathbf{1} = \left( I - \frac{1}{n} \mathbf{1}\mathbf{1}' \right)y
\]

\[
\frac{1}{n-1} (y - \bar{y}\mathbf{1})'(y - \bar{y}\mathbf{1}) = \frac{1}{n-1} y' C'C y
\]

\[
\frac{1}{n-1} y' C y
\]
\[
A = \frac{1}{n-1} \left( I - \frac{1}{n} \mathbf{1}\mathbf{1}' \right)
\]
